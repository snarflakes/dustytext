### DIVE into a text based MUD of yore, updated to the modern onchain DUST world. Energy is conserved. Death comes quick. So walk around and explore the beauty of the DUST world.  All through a custom narrative lens of biomes and terrain. Now insert an LLM for AI COOP gaming!

** Only deposit small amounts of ETH into the smart contract wallet at a time. There is NO reason to deposit large sums. This is an in-production open source engine, the engine builders receive no compensation. You are responsible for retrieving any lost sums. 

Start by sending around $0.40 of ETH Gas to Redstone chain here: <a href="https://relay.link/bridge/redstone">www.relay.link</a>

### Core:
A text MUD set in the on-chain DUST world, built for session-key, gas-abstracted play (ERC-4337 stack with Redstone bundler + Quarry paymaster). Gameplay actions are signed by a client-side session key and sent as UserOperations; the SCW validates, paymaster covers gas, and Dust contracts update world state. 

### Current play mechanics adapted from the onchain Dust World contracts 
  * Spawn, Look, Explore: baseline movement & world inspection.  Batch movement for faster but dangerous travel!
  * 360¬∞ Mining queue: directional, queued mining loops (text UI), and batched mining. 
  * Tool Crafting + Workbench: wood tools, workbench placement, and crafting flows. 
  * Surveying for water: locate water to enable farming loops. 
  * Farming loop (rudimentary, live): TILL dirt ‚Üí CRAFT bucket ‚Üí FILL bucket ‚Üí WATER ‚Üí BUILD with seeds in hand; includes wheat maturity and ‚Äúglowing wheat‚Äù. 
  * Conquer and reprogram existing depleted world Force Fields, spawntiles, and chests. Or deploy your own with simple commands! Grant/share admin access to force field territories. 

### How players connect & pay gas fees (account abstraction sketch)
  * One-time wallet connect (EOA) ‚Üí approve session key (stored client-side).
  * All gameplay signed by the session key; Bundler simulates/forwards; SCW validates; Quarry Paymaster debits prepaid gas and whitelists game calls; EntryKit handles UX & signAndSendUserOperation() plumbing. Trust model scopes the
    session key to game systems; SCW is non-custodial. 

### LLM integration today (currently supports OpenAI, rails in place for other LLM's)
  * CO-OP AI mode: an LLM drives movement/looping behaviors; in-game command like customAI "You are a barbarian woman..." to set persona.
  * Command: RegisterAI to enter your openAI api to start the fun!
  * API Keys are held only in sessionStorage and temporarily for safekeeping.
  * Set Persona "#1 DustyText guide"
  * Set "customAI Head north" to have LLM guide you safely on a fast fixed course north!

### Specifics: DUST + EntryKit + Quarry + Bundler Architecture Overview
** üîë Wallets and Session Keys **

* **EOA Wallet** (e.g. MetaMask)

  * User connects with wallet once.
  * Approves session key via signature (off-chain or via `createSession(...)`).

* **Session Key**  CURRENTLY ALL GAMEPLAY IS BASED OFF OF THIS KEY

  * A separate ephemeral private key, stored client-side.
  * Authorized by EOA to sign `UserOperations` on their behalf.
  * Used for automated gameplay actions like `move`, `jump`, etc.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Smart Contract Wallet (SCW) = Gas Handler

* Required by ERC-4337: all `UserOperations` are executed via a Smart Contract Wallet.
* SCW validates the session key during `validateUserOp()`.
* Delegates actual execution to game systems/contracts.

---

### üöõ Bundler

* Redstone now runs a bundler at `https://rpc.redstonechain.com`.
* Bundler:

  * Receives the signed `UserOperation`
  * Simulates it
  * Forwards it to the EntryPoint if valid

---

### ‚õΩ Quarry Paymaster

* Separate from the SCW
* Validates whether the user has prepaid gas in a Quarry balance
* Deducts gas on operation approval
* Interacts with both the EntryPoint and the game logic

---

### üß∞ EntryKit Overview

* EntryKit is a frontend developer toolkit for interacting with ERC-4337 smart accounts.
* It abstracts away complex parts of account abstraction:

  * Smart account deployment and connection
  * Session signer generation and registration
  * UserOperation construction and submission
  * Bundler and Quarry Paymaster integration
* EntryKit powers `signAndSendUserOperation()` and smart account UX, enabling gasless session-based gameplay.

---

### üßæ UserOperation Flow Summary

1. Session key signs a `UserOperation` (e.g., move packed direction).
2. Bundler receives and simulates the op.
3. Bundler forwards to `EntryPoint.handleOps()`.
4. EntryPoint calls:

   * `SCW.validateUserOp()` ‚Üí session key validated
   * `QuarryPaymaster.validatePaymasterUserOp()` ‚Üí checks gas balance
5. If valid, SCW delegates `execute()` to Dust contracts.
6. Game state updates.

---

### üß† Trust + Security

* The session key is only authorized to call game systems
* All logic enforcing expiration/scope lives in the SCW's validation module
* Gas limits are bounded by Quarry balance
* SCW **does not hold assets** ‚Äî it's a conduit for game execution and gas handling

---

This stack allows fully gas-abstracted, session-based gameplay on Dust ‚Äî using smart accounts only for coordination, not custody.
